# Game of life is the simplest evolution theory model. The rules are following #.

## The Rules#
### For a space that is 'populated':
Each cell with one or no neighbours' dies, as if by loneliness.
Each cell with four or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Each cell with two or three neighbours survives.
### For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'
Each cell with three neighbours becomes populated.
